Scene
	- backgrounds
		- Animation is also controlled by bpm
	- player1, 2
	- note charts
		- columns = 0 ~ 3 for player 1, 4 ~ 7 for player 2
		- create notes in milliseconds away. how to calc? I have no idea...
		- bpm이 컨트롤 해야 할 부분이지..

Player

	- Animation
		- idle
		- left
		- down
		- up
		- right
		- animation speed is affected by bpm
	- Inputs should affect Animation & note pressing => send message
